Top-Down Unity Package
===

This project aims to provide a set of features for a top-down 2D game development community.

The idea is that people will be able to build games on top of this as "mods".
People will then load the game, and activate whichever mods they wish and play whatever results.
This creates a modular game which can become anything through the mods that it has.
The project will hold some core mods so it will be, in itself a fully-featured 2d topdown game.
